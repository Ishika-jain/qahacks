API Test Cases Documentation

### API Testing Documentation

This document outlines the test cases for API functionality, using Jest as the testing framework and Supertest for making HTTP requests. The tests ensure that the API behaves as expected, following the defined specifications and validating the correctness of different operations.

#### Testing Setup:
- **BASE_URL**: The API server’s base URL, used to make requests in the test cases.
- **Authorization Token**: A bearer token for authentication, ensuring the requests are authorized to access protected endpoints.
- **Supertest**: A package used for making HTTP requests and verifying the responses from the API, allowing assertions to be made on the status code, response body, headers, and more.

#### Test Structure:
1. **Test Initialization**: Test cases may include setup functions (like `beforeAll` or `beforeEach`) to initialize data, create users, or set up conditions required for testing.
2. **Test Assertions**: Each test case includes assertions using Jest's `expect` function to verify the response's correctness (e.g., checking if the status code is as expected or if the response body matches the criteria).
3. **Error Handling**: Tests also cover edge cases, such as invalid input or unexpected responses, ensuring the API returns appropriate error codes (e.g., `400` for bad requests).

The test cases aim to validate various API endpoints' behavior, from normal use cases to edge conditions, to ensure a robust and reliable API.

Here's the test documentation based on your provided code:

---

### 1. **API-1 Delete Users**
**API Endpoint:** `/users/{userId}`  
**Method:** DELETE  
**Description:** This API deletes a user from the system based on the provided user ID. It also tests the deletion behavior, including valid and invalid cases.

#### Tests:

   - Send a DELETE request to `/users/{createdUserId}` to delete an existing user.
   - Verify that the response status is `204` (No Content).
   - Verify that the user is successfully deleted by attempting to fetch the user, expecting a `404` (Not Found).

2. **Delete Non-Existent User**
   - Send a DELETE request to `/users/{nonExistentUserId}` where the user does not exist.
   - Verify that the response status is `400` (Bad Request).

### **API-14: Add and Remove Games from Cart**

**API Endpoint:** `/users/{userId}/cart`
**Method:** POST (for adding and removing items), GET (for viewing the cart)
**Description:**  
This API allows adding and removing games from a user's shopping cart. It also includes tests for handling invalid inputs, multiple items, price calculations, and clearing the cart.

---

#### **Test Cases**

1. **Add and Remove Games from Cart:**
   - Add two games to the cart (game1 and game2) with quantities 5 and 3, respectively.
   - Remove the first game from the cart and check that the second game remains.
   - Validate that the cart reflects the correct number of items after the removal.

2. **Invalid Item Addition:**
   - Attempt to add an invalid game (non-existent UUID) to the cart.
   - Expect a 400 error due to the invalid item UUID.

3. **Negative Quantity Addition:**
   - Attempt to add an item with a negative quantity (-5).
   - Expect a 400 error as negative quantities are not allowed.

4. **Remove Item Not in Cart:**
   - Attempt to remove an item not present in the cart.
   - Expect a 400 error indicating that the item cannot be removed because it doesn't exist in the cart.

5. **Add Multiple Different Items to Cart:**
   - Add two different games (game1 and game2) with quantities 2 and 3, respectively.
   - Check if both items are correctly added to the cart.
   - Validate that the cart contains exactly 2 items.

6. **Calculate Total Cart Price:**
   - Add an item (game1) with a quantity of 2 to the cart.
   - Verify that the total price of the cart is greater than 0 after adding the item.

7. **Large Quantity Handling:**
   - Attempt to add an item with a very large quantity (10000).
   - Expect a 400 error indicating that the quantity exceeds the allowed limit (maximum 100).

8. **Clear Empty Cart:**
   - Try to clear an already empty cart.
   - Verify that the cart is empty after the clear operation.
